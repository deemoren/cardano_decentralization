# The Degree of Decentralization of Cardano blockchain
Monitor the decentralization level of Cardano blockchain.

## Cardano Decentralization API
### Prerequisites
1. Build and run Cardano on you Linux system, following this document: https://cardano-community.github.io/guild-operators/build  .
2. Make sure that you are accessible for cexplorer database.
3. Build views by following this document: https://github.com/cardanocanuck/db-sync-queries  .
4. Install python3, and install librarys: pandas/json/psycopg2/flask/math  .
5. Clone all files to your computer, and run <python3 api_launcher.py> under right dir in terminal

### How to get data 
The api address is : http://"your ip address":5000/api_collection/"api name". For example, suppose my ip address is 69.101.34.1, and I want to run gini_api.py to see the gini coefficient of Cardanoï¼Œ then I input: http://69.101.34.1:5000/api_collection/gini  in my browser.

You can see all APIs in the api/api_collection directory.

Here is a list of the function of all APIs:
 1. hello_api.py: a test API, use to test the connection, if you can run this API successfully, your environment is right, and you can run all other APIs.

 2. dpp_api.py: calculates delegators per pool, this metric is not used in measuring the decentralization level of Cardano, but if can be used in some other blockchains, depending on the reward sharing schema and protocol. 

 3. gini_api.py:calculates the Gini coefficient of Cardano. Because calculating Gini coefficient requires a huge amount of computing, please do wait for several hours if you do not have an excellent graphics card.

 4. leverage_by_owners_api.py: calculates the leverage of each pool owner. Because currently each stake pool can have several owners, this metrics can not fully represent the degree of decentralization of Cardano. However, hopefully in the forseen futhure, each Cardano staking pool will have only one owner, and at that time, this metric will be powerful.
 
 5. leverage_hash_id_api.py: calculates the leverage of each pool, regarding the set of owners of one certain pool as one identity. This is a relatively effective compromise designed for calculating the degree of decentralization of the Cardano blockchain.

 6. most_recent_api.py: calculates the most recent block number, slot number and epoch number in the database. Because the database I ued is a sync db, the daba on the chain can not be synced immediately. All the results calculated by the APIs are based on data before this "time".

 7. multi_pools_api.py: lists owners who is operating / have operated multiple pools. 

 8. pledge_rate_by_pool_api.py: calculates how many percents of the pledge are of all pools.

 9. pledge_rate_api.py: measure the pledge rage (PR) of all epoch.

 10. pool_info_api.py: lists all pools, owners, delegators, peldge, amount, the number of blocks generated by each pool, etc. This is used for the search function of the website, for users to locate one certain pool or participants.

 11. **pool_pledge_0_owner_api.py**: lists all pools without pledge.
 
 12. shannon_NCR_DL_api.py: calculates Shannon entropy, NCR, and DL divergence in one API.
 
 
## Cardano Decentralization Website
This website is developed based on Node.js. This website is just a visualization tool. 
Because the website relays on the data in my server, please visit it from : https://www.jialiang.info (hopefully this website can be visit before 13 Oct 2021 unless I get a fund or donation to support my server fee)
